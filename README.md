# The `xmeaning` package

----

The `xmeaning` package provides an enhanced interface to querry the meaning of a token. It improves the `\meaning` primitive by recognising 5 *classes* of tokens, where the output of each one of them is optimised.

The package also offers a starred variant allowing to show the meaning of the internal auxiliary macros.
